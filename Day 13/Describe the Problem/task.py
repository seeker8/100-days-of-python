# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
        # iterates the values from 1 to 20 (not inclusive)
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
        # when i is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
        # i never gets to 20, becuase the end value in range is not inclusive
